# UCSD COGS 119 Course Page

Welcome to the course page for UCSD COGS 119: Programming in Experimental Research!

In this course, you will learn state-of-the-art “tools of the trade” for doing experimental work in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. The course will provide (1) theoretical background in principles and best practices for designing effective experiments and (2) a hands-on introduction to modern tools for conducting experiments. This course is ideal for students who are interested in getting involved in experimental research and building their data science toolkit. By the end of the course, students will build an experimental 
project that they can add to their data science portfolio and take their first step as “experimentologists”.
